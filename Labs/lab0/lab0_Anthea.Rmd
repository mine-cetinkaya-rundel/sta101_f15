### (1) Familiarize yourself with the course website

The course website is at `r course_website`. This is where all course materials
will be posted.

### (2) Log on to RStudio

You will be using R and RStudio throughout the course both to learn the 
statistical concepts discussed in the texbook and also to analyze real data 
and come to informed conclusions.  To straighten out which is which: R is the 
name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.

The easiest way to access RStudio is to click on the RStudio link on the upper 
left corner of the course website. Alternatively you can directly go to 
https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers.

Then, click on the link that says **Click here to log in to your R-Studio
environment**, and log on using your NetID and password.

In the next lab you will learn about the fundamental building blocks of R and 
RStudio, but for now we just want to make sure that you can log on successfully 
and run *some* code.

The RStudio window should look something like this:

![rinterface](rInterface2015.png)

The panel in the upper right contains your *workspace* as well as a history of 
the commands that you've previously entered.  Any plots that you generate will 
show up in the panel in the lower right corner.

The panel on the left is where the action happens.  It's called the *console*.  
Everytime you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the 
console telling you the version of R that you're running.  Below that 
information is the *prompt*.  As its name suggests, this prompt is really a 
request, a request for a command.  Initially, interacting with R is all about 
typing commands and interpreting the output. These commands and their syntax 
have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a 
fairly natural way to access data and organize, describe, and invoke 
statistical computations.

You can use R as a calculator. To get you started, enter the following command 
at the R prompt (i.e. right after `>` on the console).  You can either type it 
in manually or copy and paste it from this document.

```{r}
2+2
```

And you can save this result to an object that you can access later

```{r}
x = 2+2
```

Try typing `x` in the console to verify that.

You can also see this new object in your environment on the upper right pane. 
Next time you log on to RStudio the object will still be here.

Throughout the semester you will learn about how to use R to do data analysis, 
and in the meantime you will be exposed to some programming. In addition, you 
will learn best practices for saving your code and making sure that your 
analysis is reproducible.

### (3) Familiarize yourself with Sakai

While all course materials will be distributed via the course website listed 
above, we will also use Sakai turning in assignments, grades, and forum 
discussion. Go to [Sakai](`r sakai_site`) and log on (using your NetID and 
password). If you are enrolled in the course it should be listed among your 
courses for this semester.

### (4) Sign up for Piazza

While you're on the Sakai page for this course, sign up for Piazza, which is 
the platform that we will use for online discussion related to this course. 
Click on the Piazza link on the course site, complete the enrollment, and make 
sure that you're able to view and post.

### (5) Questions for class survey

One of your first tasks in this class is to help design a survey. This survey 
will be completed anonymously. It will (ideally) have information on variables 
you are interested in working with. When writing a question think about whether 
you would feel comfortable answering it on an anonymous survey.

Work with classmates in your row to come up with a survey question, and add it 
to this [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_WRRyPRz-fgSqFOUe1vwvniz9tgu6eFUNzF8BEpjL9U/edit?usp=sharing). 
Make sure that the wording of the question is clear, and (if categorical) the 
answer choices make sense.

Before adding a question check to make sure that it hasn’t been added before. 
If your question has already been added, but you would prefer to phrase it 
differently (because you believe your phrasing is more clear / better), you can 
add it as `alternative wording' underneath the original question.

### (6) Getting to know you survey

Take the [*Getting to know you*](`r sakai_test`) survey on Sakai.

You can access this on the Tests & Quizzes tab on the Sakai site for this 
course.

### (7) Pre-test

Go to https://apps3.cehd.umn.edu/artist/user/scale_select.html and use the 
following information to take the pre-test:

```
ACCESS CODE:  `r caos_access_code`
COURSE: `r caos_section`
```

Use your **Net ID** as the student ID.

Try your best, but don't worry about it if the questions are unfamiliar to you. 
This information will only be used to place you in teams. Plus, those who 
complete the pre- and the post-test (available at the end of the semester) will 
receive extra credit on the final exam.
