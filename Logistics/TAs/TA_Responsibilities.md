Sta 101 TA Responsibilities
===========================

#### Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel & Dr. Monod
#### Fall 2015

This document contains information for Sta 101 TAs regarding the course
format and their responsibilities. The document is comprised of two parts:

- Part 1: Responsibilities of all TAs
- Part 2: Additional responsibilities of head TAs

## Part 1: Responsibilities of all TAs

Some TAs are assigned to lead lab sections and others are responsible for 
attending lectures to to help out with active learning portions of the course 
(readiness assessments, application exercises, etc.).

### Leading a lab section:

### Facilitating active learning in the classroom:

### Grading:

- Lab grading:
    + TAs leading lab sections will also grade lab reports of their students.
    + Labs are completed in teams.
    + Lab grading is due one week from the due date, at the beginning of the
    following lab session.
    + Only students who were present in the lab session are listed as 
    author / discussant and receive points for the labs.
- Problem set (PS) grading:
    + All TAs will split problem set grading, divided amongst them based on
    hours they have available.
    + PSs are completed individually.
    + PS grading is due 9am on the Friday following the due date of the PS,
    no exceptions.
- If you anticipate not being able to complete the grading by the deadline, 
you must let the professor know ahead of time so that arrangements can be made.
- Stick closely to the answer key. If you catch an error on the key, or if 
something is not clear, email the professor and all TAs immediately to resolve 
the issue. This will save everyone time. If the error is minor, feel free to go 
in and edit the key directly.
- Note where you take off points, and provide ample *constructive* feedback.
- Take off points for formatting issues, especially in the first couple assignments
so that expectations are communicated early on.
- **Regrades:**
    + We only consider regrade requests in the case of errors in tallying points. 
    + All regrade requests must go through the head TA -- simply direct the students 
    to the head TA. 
    + If a student emails you about a regrade, forward the email to the head TA, 
    and cc the student letting them know this is what you're doing.

### Office hours:

- All TAs are expected to hold office 2 hours of office hours / week.
- Students from either of the Sta 101 sections might attend the office hours.

### Piazza:

- Piazza is the online discussion forum, and can be accessed via the Sakai site.
- Periodically, and any time you don't have a student with you during office
hours, answer questions on Piazza.
- You will be assigned a TA role on Piazza, which means that your responses will 
be tagged as such.
- Adjust your settings so that you're notified when a note is posted on Piazza.
Respond to student questions periodically. Do not just give away the answers, 
instead respond in a way that enables the students to get to the right answer. 
Don't hesitate to answer a question with a question that helps the student think 
through the problem. 
- If it says "anon to students" do not use the student's name in your response, 
as it means the student wanted to keep their name anonymous to other students 
in the class.
- Always first invite the students to start the discussion / provide their thoughts 
if they haven't done so in their original question.

### Weekly meetings:

- We will hold weekly teaching staff meetings on Fridays 10-11am.
- All TAs must attend these meetings. Be punctual so that we can get started
and finish on time.
- If you cannot attend a TA meeting, you must notify Dr. Cetinkaya-Rundel
and/or Dr. Monod ahead of time.
- Format of meetings:
    1. Recap of the past week: TAs provide feedback on the past week: what seems to 
    be challenging for students, commonly missed questions on the assignments, 
    questions that commonly come up during office hours, team dynamics, etc.
    2. Head TAs give a report on grading tasks completed / to be completed.
    2. Faculty introduces topics to be discussed in the following week, and 
    any upcoming deadlines to watch out for.
    3. Discussion of upcoming lab:
        + Each week one TA presents the upcoming lab. This presentation should take 
        roughly 10 minutes and should be a **complete rehearsal** of how you plan on 
        presenting the lab to the students. You should also spend a few minutes to 
        discussing any potential difficulties that might arise during the lab. 
        + The presenter is be responsible for either creating or reviewing the
        key for the week's lab.
        + All TAs must also review the lab (i.e. actually do the entire lab) and 
        come to the meeting with suggestions / questions regarding how best to 
        present it in class.

### Lab sections:

- As a TA your main duty is to lead lab sections. 
    + This course uses R/RStudio. For purposes of this course access RStudio at https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers using your NetID.
    + Students are expected to create completely reproducible lab reports and projects using RMarkdown/knitr. Prior to the first lab make sure that you are familiar with these tools/packages.
    + Get to lab a few minutes earlier to make sure the instructor computer and projector are working. 
    + Take attendance during the lab sections. You can do this informally (as opposed to calling out names) and use it as an opportunity to get to know your students' names. Print out the team roster for your section and check of names as you interact with each team. (Attendance information will be useful when grading the lab reports.)
    + Flow of lab sections: 
        - 5-10 minutes of introduction to lab and the data set. Make sure students are engaged (not going ahead with the lab on their computers). This introduction should convey the main ideas/skills of the lab.
        - Let students continue with the lab (in teams) while you spend a little bit of time with each team and answer any questions. You should *never* be just sitting behind the instructor computer.
        - From time-to-time address the whole class, making sure teams are progressing roughly at the same rate, and go over any challenging exercises.
        - At the end of the lab for the first few weeks remind the students the deadline and submission instructions.
    + During the lab sections you're also tasked with ensuring smooth and efficient teamwork:
        - If any students are unengaged explicitly ask them to work with their teams.
        - Ask students to change their seating order each week so that each student gets a chance to be in the "middle".
        - Ensure that teams follow the author assignments, and the authors rotate each week.
    + If you must miss a lab, make arrangements for another TA to fill in for you well in advance. <br><br>
